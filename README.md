## [From Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belote)
Belote (French pronunciation: ​[bəlɔt]) is a 32-card trick-taking game played in France, 
and is one of the most popular card games in that country. 
It was invented around 1920. 
Definitive rules of the game were first published in 1921

Within the game's terminology, belote is used to designate a pair of a King and a Queen of a trump suit, 
possibly yielding the game's name itself.
